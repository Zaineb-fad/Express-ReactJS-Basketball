days after scoring a fine goal against West Ham, Pogba’s exit wish was revealed by his agent\r\nReal Madrid, PSG and Juventus have all been linked with Pogba over the past few years, and could he finally be nearing the end of his time at Old Trafford?\r\n\r\nPogba is said to be ‘unhappy‘ in Manchester and Raiola believes the ‘best solution’ is for him to leave United as early as January, when the transfer window reopens.\r\n\r\nThe agent has been widely criticised for speaking out, rather than Pogba doing so himself – especially as Raiola’s quotes came just one day ahead of a crunch Champions League clash with RB Leipzig and with the Manchester derby to follow at the weekend.\r\n\r\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer now has a big decision on his hands with only weeks to go before the transfer window opens once again, with ‘Pogba in’ or ‘Pogba out’ a huge dilemma.\r\n\r\nWhat Raiola said about Paul Pogba\r\n“I can say it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.“There’s no use ignoring it. It’s better to speak honestly, look to the future and not waste time trying to blame people: Paul is unhappy at Manchester United, he can no longer express himself as he wants to or in the way that’s expected of him.“He needs to change team, he needs a change of scene. He has a contract that expires in a year and a half’s time, in the summer of 2022, but I think the best solution would be for him to leave in the next transfer window.“Otherwise the club from Old Trafford, with whom he has a good relationship, know very well that they risk losing him on a free transfer, considering that right now he does not want to extend his deal.“If people don’t get that, they know very little about football. In any case, they’ll all blame me if Paul leaves next summer.”\r\nWell, one United fan joined talkSPORT on Monday and offered his own advise as to how Solskjaer should proceed with the situation.\r\n\r\nAnd Barry the Red Devil said he’d gladly get rid of Pogba – with Arsenal outcast Ozil the perfect signing to replace him with.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether [Pogba] is happy or

must-draw Champions League match against RB Leipzig – which is LIVE on talkSPORT on Tuesday night – Raiola seized the opportunity to put his client up for sale yet again, despite little transfer speculation and a return to form for Pobga over the weekend.\r\n\r\nEven still, Raiola’s comments do not come as too much of a surprise, given his outspoken nature.\r\n\r\nThe agent has made numerous public statements about Pogba down the years, and more recently he was very vocal about Man United’s failed pursuit of Erling Haaland, another one of his clients.\r\n\r\nAlongside hoping to engineer a transfer for Pogba, Raiola is also trying to ‘delete the FIFA video game from existing’ due to a copyright dispute between EA Sports and his client Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\r\n\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n                      <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image

bigging himself up,” O’Hara told Tuesday’s talkSPORT Breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got this player, I can end FIFA, Pogba’s finished – just shut up, mate!\r\n\r\n“Seriously, if he was my agent, I would phone him up and say, ‘Keep your mouth shut, I’m playing for Manchester United, I’m not playing well, I’ve just scored on the weekend and now I’m thrown all over the papers again’.”\r\n\r\nThere are some suggestions that Pogba would’ve known about his agent’s comments, but O’Hara was keen to defend the Frenchman from any blame, insisting responsibility for the saga lies with Raiola.\r\n\r\nPlay

statement in advance, then he’s got to leave, but I don’t think he’s like that.\r\n\r\n“Whether or not he’s happy at Man United, I still think he’s a professional, he still wants to do well for the club, and when he plays, he tries.\r\n\r\n“Your agent is someone who represents you off the field, who keeps their mouth shut and does business behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have an agent who is constantly running their mouth off to the press, that is not what you’re hired to do.\r\n\r\n“I wish he would just shut up and let Pogba play his football.”\r\n\r\ntalkSPORT brings you full LIVE

surprise, given Pogba recently returned to the Red Devils’ starting XI and scored a stunning goal in the victory over West Ham.\r\n\r\nIt also came on the eve of Man United’s biggest game of the season so far, as they travel to RB Leipzig needing a draw to get out of their Champions League group.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the first time Raiola has stirred up trouble for Man United with regards to Pogba.\r\n\r\nThe super agent orchestrated the Frenchman’s move from United to Juventus in 2012, leading Sir Alex Ferguson to call Raiola a ‘s***bag’ for the way he behaved in those negotiations.\r\n\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nHe added: “If you dissect what it does say, I don’t necessarily disagree that Pogba should go in

numerous occasions about the 27-year-old’s desire to leave.\r\n\r\nAnd McCoist has had enough, accusing Raiola of selfishness.\r\n\r\n“The timing is shocking, and at the very best it’s selfish,” the Rangers legend told talkSPORT.\r\n\r\n“I actually had to laugh at the bit about Paul being unhappy. I know one or two Man United fans who are quite unhappy with Paul!\r\n\r\n“Who does he think he is coming out with that at this point in time?”\r\n\r\nPogba has never really hit the heights expected of him for Man United\r\n\r\nAFP OR LICENSORS\r\n3\r\nPogba has never really hit the heights expected of him for Man United\r\nHe added: “The timing is just so selfish, Man United and Solskjaer have got a massive game tonight, absolutely massive, a game they cannot afford to lose, and he’s coming out with this nonsense.”\r\n\r\nNonetheless, McCoist does agree that it would be in everybody’s interest for Pogba to leave United in January.\r\n\r\nThe France midfielder has one-and-a-half years left on his contract – and the Red Devils risk losing him on a free unless they can tie him down to new deal, which seems increasingly unlikely.\r\n\r\nBesides, Pogba has struggled to get into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s starting XI this season ahead of the likes of Fred and Scott McTominay.\r\n\r\nPlay Video\r\nMan United fan offers to drive Paul Pogba to Juventus and bring Matthijs de Ligt back\r\n“If his contract expires in a year and a half, this probably is the best moment in time to sell him, because his value will be decreasing,” McCoist said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think the move has been a very talented player, he’s won a World Cup, but he’s not really hit it at Man United.\r\n\r\n“Ole clearly prefers Fred and McTominay in the holding positions in the middle of the park. He’s not going to play before Fernandes.”\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./204.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Transfers5.component.js",["488","489"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Transfers5.component.css\";\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                     <h1>A Manchester United fan has told talkSPORT the Red Devils should sell Paul Pogba…</h1> <p>\r\n                       and sign Mesut Ozil as his replacement\r\n\r\nThe France midfielder’s agent, Mino Raiola, came out on Monday and said it’s ‘over’ for Pogba at United to once again cast doubts over his future.\r\n\r\nJust a few days after scoring a fine goal against West Ham, Pogba’s exit wish was revealed by his agent\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n2\r\nJust a few days after scoring a fine goal against West Ham, Pogba’s exit wish was revealed by his agent\r\nReal Madrid, PSG and Juventus have all been linked with Pogba over the past few years, and could he finally be nearing the end of his time at Old Trafford?\r\n\r\nPogba is said to be ‘unhappy‘ in Manchester and Raiola believes the ‘best solution’ is for him to leave United as early as January, when the transfer window reopens.\r\n\r\nThe agent has been widely criticised for speaking out, rather than Pogba doing so himself – especially as Raiola’s quotes came just one day ahead of a crunch Champions League clash with RB Leipzig and with the Manchester derby to follow at the weekend.\r\n\r\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer now has a big decision on his hands with only weeks to go before the transfer window opens once again, with ‘Pogba in’ or ‘Pogba out’ a huge dilemma.\r\n\r\nWhat Raiola said about Paul Pogba\r\n“I can say it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.“There’s no use ignoring it. It’s better to speak honestly, look to the future and not waste time trying to blame people: Paul is unhappy at Manchester United, he can no longer express himself as he wants to or in the way that’s expected of him.“He needs to change team, he needs a change of scene. He has a contract that expires in a year and a half’s time, in the summer of 2022, but I think the best solution would be for him to leave in the next transfer window.“Otherwise the club from Old Trafford, with whom he has a good relationship, know very well that they risk losing him on a free transfer, considering that right now he does not want to extend his deal.“If people don’t get that, they know very little about football. In any case, they’ll all blame me if Paul leaves next summer.”\r\nWell, one United fan joined talkSPORT on Monday and offered his own advise as to how Solskjaer should proceed with the situation.\r\n\r\nAnd Barry the Red Devil said he’d gladly get rid of Pogba – with Arsenal outcast Ozil the perfect signing to replace him with.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether [Pogba] is happy or unhappy because he never actually tells us himself,” said Barry on Drive.\r\n\r\n“But I would say he should come out and say ‘I want to stay’ or ‘I don’t want to stay, and I want to go’.\r\n\r\n“And I would let him go and get the £100million.\r\n\r\nOzil is not in Arsenal’s Premier League or Europa League squads this season – is he the perfect signing for Man United?\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./201.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       GETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n2\r\nOzil is not in Arsenal’s Premier League or Europa League squads this season – is he the perfect signing for Man United?\r\n“And I am just throwing one in at you, because I think [Jose] Mourinho might try to sign him [for Spurs] – Mesut Ozil, maybe on a free.\r\n\r\n“I would throw him in at United as a creative player, and get rid of Fred and [Anthony] Martial.\r\n\r\n“I think Ozil would be a good signing for United and I think him, [Donny] Van de Beek and [Bruno] Fernandes would gel quite well.\r\n\r\n“I know he’s not a grafter – everybody knows that – but he’s just got that spark and quality that we need; maybe what Pogba has got but doesn’t quite show us often enough.”\r\n\r\ntalkSPORT brings you full LIVE commentary of RB Leipzig vs Manchester United in the Champions League, kick-off 8pm  \r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./202.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Transfers7.component.js",["490","491"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Transfers7.component.css\";\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

However surely Paul knew he was making this announcement? If he wasn’t aware then we should see a quote from him very soon correcting his agent. Finally to do this ahead of Leipzig and the Man Derby is terrible timing for the Team.”\r\n\r\nPogba is contracted to United until 2022 after the club recently triggered the extension clause in his deal.\r\n\r\nThe 27-year-old has been linked with a return to Juventus, whilst Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane is also a known admirer of his compatriot.\r\n\r\nPogba publicly admitted his openness to a move away from United in June 2019, saying: “I think for me it can be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else.”\r\n\r\nThe midfielder stayed at Old Trafford and endured an injury-hit

Raiola has been told to ‘shut up and let Paul Pogba play football’</h1> <p>\r\n                        by former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara.\r\n\r\nPogba’s name was all over the back pages this morning after the Frenchman’s agent publicly announced his time at Old Trafford is ‘over’.\r\n\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n2\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months\r\nWith all eyes on United’s must-draw Champions League match against RB Leipzig – which is LIVE on talkSPORT on Tuesday night – Raiola seized the opportunity to put his client up for sale yet again, despite little transfer speculation and a return to form for Pobga over the weekend.\r\n\r\nEven still, Raiola’s comments do not come as too much of a surprise, given his outspoken nature.\r\n\r\nThe agent has made numerous public statements about Pogba down the years, and more recently he was very vocal about Man United’s failed pursuit of Erling Haaland, another one of his clients.\r\n\r\nAlongside hoping to engineer a transfer for Pogba, Raiola is also trying to ‘delete the FIFA video game from existing’ due to a copyright dispute between EA Sports and his client Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\r\n\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n2\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\nAnd O’Hara is quite frankly sick of it.\r\n\r\n“He’s all about himself, making a name for himself and bigging himself up,” O’Hara told Tuesday’s talkSPORT Breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got this player, I can end FIFA, Pogba’s finished – just shut up, mate!\r\n\r\n“Seriously, if he was my agent, I would phone him up and say, ‘Keep you mouth shut, I’m playing for Manchester United, I’m not playing well, I’ve just scored on the weekend and now I’m thrown all over the papers again’.”\r\n\r\nThere are some suggestions that Pogba would’ve known about his agent’s comments, but O’Hara was keen to defend the Frenchman from any blame, insisting responsibility for the saga lies with Raiola.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n

he’s like that.\r\n\r\n“Whether or not he’s happy at Man United, I still think he’s a professional, he still wants to do well for the club, and when he plays, he tries.\r\n\r\n“Your agent is someone who represents you off the field, who keeps their mouth shut and does business behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have an agent who is constantly running their mouth off to the press, that is not what you’re hired to do.\r\n\r\n“I wish he would just shut up and let Pogba play his football.”\r\n\r\ntalkSPORT brings you full LIVE commentary of RB Leipzig vs Manchester United in the Champions

Manchester United fan has joked he’s ready to drive Paul Pogba to Juventus and bring back Matthijs de Ligt with him following Mino Raiola’s ill-timed comments regarding the Frenchman’s future.\r\n\r\nSpeculation that Pogba will leave the Red Devils has been ramped up following comments made by his agent Raiola.\r\n\r\nPaul Pogba is unhappy at Man United according to his agent </h4><p>\r\n                       \r\n\r\nAFP\r\n4\r\nPaul Pogba is unhappy at Man United according to his agent\r\nHe claimed the France World Cup winner’s time at United was ‘over’, declaring he is ‘unhappy’ at Old Trafford and ‘unable to express himself’.\r\n\r\nThe 27-year-old came through the youth ranks at the club before joining Juventus where he made himself a star name.\r\n\r\nUnited re-signed him back in 2016 for a then record fee of £89million but has often been a source of frustration during a tumultuous period in the club’s history.\r\n\r\nRumours have persisted that Pogba could return to Juventus and the fact that Raiola said the comments to an Italian publication will only fuel the fire.\r\n\r\nPogba’s agent Mino Raiola made the explosive comments to an Italian publication\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nPogba’s agent Mino Raiola made the explosive comments to an Italian publication\r\nGary the Man United fan phoned talkSPORT’s Drive on Monday and proposed a deal that could suit both parties.\r\n\r\nHe said: “I’ll drive him to Turin myself and pick up Matthijs De Ligt on the way back.\r\n\r\n“Let’s not mess about with ‘here you are have Dybala, have this that or the other’. Let’s address the issues with our team.\r\n\r\n“We need a centre-back, we need a holding midfielder. Let’s have De Ligt and you have Pogba thanks very much.\r\n\r\n“I can count on one hand how many times he played well for Man United in four or five years now.\r\n\r\n“I agree, yes on paper he’s a very good player but should be an awful lot better than what he’s showing for Man United.\r\n\r\n“At some point, you’ve got to draw a line under it and that’s now. Let’s move on, get him out the door and get better players in, particularly at the back as anyone with eyes can see that’s where our problems are.\r\n\r\nMatthijs de Ligt signed for Juventus from Ajax in 2019\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n4\r\nMatthijs de Ligt signed for Juventus from Ajax in 2019\r\n“We don’t need to be playing two holding midfielders all the time because we’ve got weak centre-backs.\r\n\r\n“Let’s address that, get that sorted, get that man and the virus that is attached to him – his agent – out of the club. I don’t want anything to do with them and let’s move forward.”\r\n\r\nOne thing that Gary may be forgetting is that De Ligt’s agent is in fact Raiola, so there would be little chance in getting rid of him.\r\n\r\nThe quotes from the agent have slowly started to emerge on Monday afternoon following an explosive interview with Tuttosport.\r\n\r\nPaul Pogba rejoined Man United in 2016\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n4\r\nPaul Pogba rejoined Man United in 2016\r\nIn it he said: “Paul is unhappy with Man United as he is no longer able to express himself in the way that he would like and as he is expected to. Paul needs a new team, a change of air. He is under contract for the next 18 months and it will expire in the summer of 2022.\r\n\r\n“However, I think that the best solution for both Pogba and Man Utd is that he goes in the next transfer window. If not, the Old Trafford club know that they risk losing him on a free transfer as it is not Paul’s intention to extend his contract.\r\n\r\n“Manchester United board know the risk losing Pogba for free given the player has no intention of extending. If somebody does not understand that, then they do not understand football. In any case, let them blame me if Paul leaves.”\r\n\r\nRB Leipzig vs Manchester United is LIVE on talkSPORT on Tuesday night, kick-off 8pm\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./207.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       \r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./208.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Boxing2.component.js",["496","497"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Boxing2.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

Pulev early on\r\n\r\nGETTY - CONTRIBUTOR\r\n4\r\nKlitschko decked Pulev early on\r\nPulev’s sole defeat came against Wladimir Klitschko on November 15, 2014.\r\n\r\nThis is the Bulgarian’s only world title fight to date and saw him laid out flat on his back after five rounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pulev did emerge from the bout with a fair amount of credit.\r\n\r\nMany of Klitschko’s title defences underwhelmed in terms of drama and excitement, whereas Pulev forced a firefight from the opening bell.\r\n\r\nPulev mocked Klitschko, but it didn’t end well for him\r\n\r\n4\r\nPulev mocked Klitschko, but it didn’t end well for him\r\nThe bout began with Pulev on the offensive, which quickly left him open to the champion’s left hook.\r\n\r\nKlitschko floored his challenger after just one minute of the first round, but was met with a defiant response.\r\n\r\nPulev rose to his feet on seemingly unsteady legs and then taunted the Ukrainian by standing on one leg and sticking his tongue out at him.\r\n\r\nKlitschko replied by knocking him down again straight away – Pulev again made it back to his feet and survived the round.\r\n\r\nThe left hook battered Pulev\r\n\r\nEV\r\n\r\n

action exploded once again in the third.\r\n\r\nThis time it was the right hand from Klitschko that hurt Pulev, followed by a left hook which put him down once more.\r\n\r\nThe challenger survived round three and even made it through round four, but the writing was clearly on the wall.\r\n\r\nIt was ‘job done’ for Klitschko\r\n\r\nGETTY - CONTRIBUTOR\r\n4\r\nIt was ‘job done’ for Klitschko\r\nIn the fifth, Klitschko landed one final crunching left hook which flattened Pulev.\r\n\r\nHe was unable to beat the count.\r\n\r\nKlitschko went on to be dethroned by Tyson Fury a year later before then being knocked out by Anthony Joshua in 2017.\r\n\r\nPulev has since rebuilt with wins over the likes of Dereck Chisora and Hughie Fury, and now gets his opportunity once

Klitschko propelled him to superstardom but his unbeaten dominance came to a shuddering end at the hands of Mexican Ruiz in 2019.\r\n\r\nThat defeat in New York drew massive criticism but he answered all his doubters by winning their rematch in Saudi Arabia in stunning fashion last December.\r\n\r\nAJ will be eager to keep his critics at bay by beating Pulev this weekend ahead of a potential

Everyone has got their own motivations going in; Wales have got a lot to prove off of what they will view as a very disappointing Six Nations, Ireland will be disappointed to have not wrapped it up in the last game and France have got to show if this is a sustained improvement in terms of quality of their performance.\r\n\r\n“Everyone has got different motivations, but I think England have been the standard-bearers for a number of years now so they, in my opinion, are the team to beat now definitely.”\r\n\r\nAUTUMN NATIONS CUP SCHEDULE\r\nThe Autumn Nations Cup will be the first full competitive international rugby union tournament after a six-month break.

We used to attack quite well and there’s been a shift there in how they approach the game.\r\n\r\n“There was noise around that in 2019 when we went to the World Cup which didn’t materialise; that focus on kick chasing, defence and all that stuff which isn’t as glamorous but certainly makes up the best teams.\r\n\r\n“It would be more concerning if our defence wasn’t as good as it is, it has been phenomenal. The stand-off thing is a bit of a concern; Duncan Weir has been playing well for Worcester and also Jaco van der Walt, who I played with at Edinburgh.”\r\n\r\nThe Scots face Italy in the first ever Autumn Cup fixture, before facing a revitalised France in the second round of fixtures.\r\n\r\nDupont, 23, is slowly but surely proving to be one of the best No.9’s in the world\r\n\r\nAFP OR LICENSORS\r\n4\r\nDupont, 23, is slowly but surely proving to be one of the best No.9’s in the world\r\nAlthough victory against the French ended in fisticuffs, a flurry of tries and a resounding victory for the hosts at Murrayfield, Barclay is wary of superstar scrum-half Antoine Dupont.\r\n\r\n“For me, as a fan, he is a real pleasure to watch,” Barclay added. “You watch and you marvel and there aren’t many players I watch and think, ‘Wow’.\r\n\r\n“He’s almost playing a different sport right now and he is at that level I think at the moment.”\r\n\r\nAutumn Nations Cup Rugby Union is coming to Amazon Prime Video, exclusively broadcasting 13 out of 16 matches from 14 November including the tournament finals  \r\n                      \r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./262.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Rugbyunion9.component.js",["516","517"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Rugbyunion9.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

The television match official took an age to deliberate and eventually wiped the try off and England failed to hold on and succumbed to a 6-15 loss.\r\n\r\nAs well as costing the Red Rose the chance to become the first nation to retain the World Cup, it cost Cueto the chance to etch his name into sporting history.\r\n\r\nAnd the 40-year-old believes football officials must learn from the mistakes already made this season with VAR or risk ‘spoiling’ the game.\r\n\r\n“I think you’ve got to learn from it, you’ve got to give it a chance,” Cueto told talkSPORT.com.\r\n\r\nDanie Rossouw applied pressure to the Sale Sharks winger in the corner\r\n\r\nAFP - GETTY\r\n5\r\nDanie Rossouw applied pressure to the Sale Sharks winger in the corner\r\nAndrew Sheridan consoled the winger in the French capital after the defeat\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n5\r\nAndrew Sheridan consoled the winger in the French capital after the defeat\r\n“And I think the biggest thing is for me – without saying the wrong thing here – in football, people are too quick to say ‘it doesn’t work’ and what to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n“As opposed to siting down and saying ‘it isn’t working, but why isn’t it working?’ It would bring some clarity to the areas it is a bit ambiguous.\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, there are all these other sports in the world that are using technology and it has improved the sport.

But deep down, I know if that final was played tomorrow, the right call would be made.\r\n\r\n“There have been improvements and we have moved on, everybody has moved on with the technology and ultimately the game has improved and it’s a better experience for everybody.\r\n\r\n“In football, VAR has been around for about three years now and we still seem to be on day one with it. There’s no clarity, there is no problem solving – it just stays a mess and everyone makes a joke about how it is so bad.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, ultimately, the FA or UEFA has got to get a grip on it and add some clarity.

There’s no clarity, there is no problem solving – it just stays a mess and everyone makes a joke about how it is so bad.\r\n\r\n“I suppose, ultimately, the FA or UEFA has got to get a grip on it and add some clarity.

Obviously they acknowledge what they did and they are really regretful and ashamed of what they did, and we all are.”\r\n\r\n“I can say they are not the same people they were when they were 17, 18 years old.\r\n\r\n“They are great men, family men, Pablo has a kid now, he’s a great leader and a great example.”\r\n\r\nCentre Jeronimo de la Fuente will lead the side against Australia on Saturday, with Matias Alemanno replacing Petti in a new second row with Marcos Kremer.

Andy Farrell’s men finished third while a rejuvenated France were runners-up.\r\n\r\nHaving dismantled Italy, England returned to their team hotel to have dinner and watch events in Paris unfold knowing they were in the driving seat heading into the final element’.\r\n\r\nEngland comprehensively defeated Italy in Rome\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n5\r\nEngland comprehensively defeated Italy in Rome\r\nThere was already an air of celebration after Ben Youngs marked his 100th cap by crossing twice, a brilliant second try coming moments after the interval when Owen Farrell’s side looked for a response to a ragged and bad tempered first half.\r\n\r\nSuffering from the cancellation of the Barbarians fixture that was to be their warm-up, they looked every bit a team that needed to blow away the cobwebs.\r\n\r\nItaly fought hard but when Jamie George touched down on his 50th cap, any remote hopes of staging an upset faded and England registered the crucial bonus point when Tom Curry surged over from close range.\r\n\r\nIreland were defeated by France in Paris\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n5\r\nIreland were defeated by France in Paris\r\nHenry Slade added the fifth and final try to set up an anxious wait for the outcome at the Stade de France.\r\n\r\nAll week they talked about the need to show patience in shaking off the rustiness of having not played since mid-March, but it took only four minutes to breach the home defence.\r\n\r\nMako Vunipola was the engineer, the Saracens prop standing at first receiver and sending Owen Farrell into a gap before Youngs appeared on his shoulder to finish the move.\r\n\r\nItaly were in full retreat in every department and it took furious defence to keep out the white shirts, so it was a conservative decision when Farrell opted for three points when offered a penalty in front of the posts.\r\n\r\nEngland pressed again but a fumble by Kyle Sinckler was pounced upon by centre Carlo Canna, who gathered and carried before a rampaging Jake Polledri arrived on an excellent line to storm over the whitewash.\r\n\r\nFrance came so close but ultimately could not reduce England’s point deficit\r\n\r\n\r\n

setback came in the 23rd minute when Jonny Hill’s debut soured upon catching Edoardo Padovani on the head with an arm, forcing the Italian wing to undergo an HIA and earning the Chiefs double-winner a yellow card.\r\n\r\nJones slammed down his radio device in anger at referee Pascal Gauzere’s decision and what followed would not have pleased the Australian head coach either.\r\n\r\nItaly began to attack with tempo and made inroads, winning successive penalties which they cleverly used to build pressure.\r\n\r\nA driving line-out took them over the whitewash but they were held up with Hill under the ball and they crumbled at the ensuing five-metre scrum, costing them a glorious chance.\r\n\r\nJones has been hugely successful as England head coach\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n5\r\nJones has been hugely successful as England head coach\r\nPolledri entered the sin-bin for going in at the side but just as England began to hammer away from close range, they conceded a penalty to enable Italy to escape and even momentarily threaten at the other end.\r\n\r\nAn unimpressive 10-5 interval lead was extended 56 seconds into the second half when Hill charged down a box kick and Maro Itoje secured the loose ball.\r\n\r\nSpotting a gap at the ruck, Youngs dummied and slid through the hole before beating full-back Matteo Minozzi.\r\n\r\nWith half an hour to go, daylight opened up as George finished a driving maul but Italy refused to fold as they continued to scrap.\r\n\r\nFinally they began to buckle, Curry spotting an unguarded blindside to scamper over before Ben Earl and Slade took advantage of an absent Azzurri defence for the latter to complete the rout.\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n

new-look tournament, May burst into life with a second try which left viewers at home completely stunned.\r\n\r\nThe stern English defence turned the ball over on the near side, before it was recycled out to the left hand side to May who revved up his engine and got his legs pumping.\r\n\r\nHaving seen off two challenges, the 30-year-old then chipped ahead and raced onto the ball to touch down to complete a stunning score.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay’s incredible second score – his 31st at international level – made him the joint second highest try-scorer in his country’s history alongside Will Greenwood and Ben Cohen.\r\n\r\nAnd he was lavished with praise on social media – with one fan even comparing May to Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

pm\r\nVideo footage has emerged of SEVEN Barbarians players flouting coronavirus rules, which led to their clash against England being cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe RFU pulled the plug on the fixture after it emerged there were two separate breaches from Barbarians players leaving the bio-secure team hotel on Park Lane, London, ahead of the scheduled game at Twickenham this weekend.\r\n\r\nFormer England captain Chris Robshaw was among the Barbarians who broke the COVID rules\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image

@EDWARDB24376757\r\n1\r\nFormer England captain Chris Robshaw was among the Barbarians who broke the COVID rules\r\nHowever, Rugby Onslaught have revealed a video of several high profile members of the team drinking alcohol together in a pub, including Sean Maitland and former England captain Chris Robshaw.\r\n\r\nJackson Wray, Joel Kpoku, Fergus McFadden and Manu Vunipola are also among the group who appear to be playing a drinking game at what is believed to be a pub in Mayfair.\r\n\r\nRobshaw appears to be at the centre of things with the players engaging in what Rugby Onslaught describe as a ‘team bonding experience’. Below you can see the video.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second breach then took place the following night when Robshaw and eleven others went to a restaurant after which five players including Robshaw and his former England team-mate Richard Wigglesworth issued apologies for their behaviour.\r\n\r\nNone of the players have tested positive for COVID but the RFU were concerned any incubating infections could put the Six Nations in jeopardy with England’s match against Italy a week on Saturday, while the Autumn Nations Cup kicks off next month.\r\n\r\nThe cancellation of the game serves is a huge blow to the RFU, who are already set to lose £100million of revenue due to the pandemic. It’s understood the cancellation is set to cost the RFU around £1m in lost TV and sponsor revenue.\r\n\r\nA spokesperson said: “An ongoing investigation is looking into players who signed up to a code of conduct which included not leaving the hotel without permission.” \r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image

2020, 11:42 pm\r\nEngland’s game against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday has been plunged into major doubt after the Rugby Football Union (RFU) revealed several Baa-baas players breached coronavirus protocols.\r\n\r\nThe RFU claims several players left the team hotel without permission or informing organisers of their whereabouts on Wednesday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon their return they were expelled from the Barbarians squad.\r\n\r\nThe RFU said if there was a further round of COVID-19 testing on the players who left the bubble, there would be no guarantees that they are not infectious in the period up to and including the match.\r\n\r\nA decision will be made about whether the match can go ahead by 3pm on Friday, but those who have breached protocols have been forbidden from participating in Sunday’s fixture.\r\n\r\nThe RFU statement read: “To protect the safety of other participants, these players cannot be permitted to remain with the Barbarians squad and play in Sunday’s fixture.\r\n\r\n“If sufficient new players with an appropriate testing history and who have been meeting the code of conduct standards can be brought into the Barbarians camp then the game will go ahead.\r\n\r\n“The RFU scheduled the Quilter Cup Barbarians fixture for performance purposes in order to provide a warm-up game ahead of the postponed Italy v England Guinness Six Nations

“Barbarian F.C. have expressed their extreme disappointment in the conduct of the players involved and have taken all necessary steps to ensure the safety of the players and staff within the bubble.\r\n\r\n“The club are working closely with the RFU as they determine whether the Quilter Cup can go ahead.\r\n\r\n“The RFU will provide an update on the match status by 3pm on Friday 23 October.\r\n\r\n“No details on the individuals who will be in or out of the revised Barbarians squad will be announced until the fixture is re-confirmed.”\r\n\r\nThe Barbarians are now left with a

40-year-old\r\nThe rugby league icon aimed to raised £77,777 in honour of his close friend Burrow, who was diagnosed with MND in December 2019.\r\n\r\nBut the campaign has surpassed even his wildest expectations, toppling £2m in funds raised on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n“I’m so buoyed by the support and where that fund’s got to, but from a body perspective I’ve just got one sore Achilles and that’s it,” he told talkSPORT.\r\n\r\nSinfield was captain for most of Burrow’s 17 years at Leeds Rhinos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6}

I’ve run a number of marathons after I finished playing, especially during lockdown, I picked up the running more than ever.\r\n\r\n“But in effect, getting used to running and walking on tired legs was what the training was all about. So a couple of half-marathons, bit of rest, then some 12km walks to build it up.”\r\n\r\nSinfield was inspired to run by his former partner in crime Burrow, who was the subject of a heart-breaking BBC documentary about MND recently.\r\n\r\n“Rob’s playing career speaks for itself; anyone who follows rugby league will know what a champion he was on the field,” Sinfield added.\r\n\r\nBurrow is Sinfield’s inspiration\r\n\r\nREX FEATURES\r\n4\r\nBurrow is Sinfield’s inspiration\r\n“He was 5ft 4ins and defied all the odds, and off the field he’s been a great friend.\r\n\r\n“What we’ve seen very quickly is that the disease takes away some of your functions. Rob is in a wheelchair and uses his phone to speak.\r\n\r\n“For us, his teammates, it’s horrific to see. The challenges now – for Rob, who’s 38, his wife, three kids, mum and dad, he’s got such a beautiful family – is to try and make the best of this horrible situation.\r\n\r\n“That was always our inspiration in all this. But we’ve found the support from the whole MND community has been incredible.”\r\n\r\nYou can donate to Sinfield’s cause in aid of Burrow and MND here.\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./272.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Sport2.component.js",["534","535"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Sport2.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                      <h6>Tyson Fury has revealed the incredible amount he eats on a cheat day when he is not religiously checking his calories before a fight.\r\n\r\n‘The Gypsy King’ is a huge believer in health and fitness after regaining the world heavyweight title in February of this year.\r\n\r\nFury ballooned up in weight as he struggled to cope with mental health issues, but displayed tremendous bravery and persistence to lose the weight he gained and return to the ring in June 2018.\r\n\r\nTyson Fury wrenched the WBC heavyweight title from Wilder’s grasp in February</h6><p>\r\n                      \r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n3\r\nTyson Fury wrenched the WBC heavyweight title from Wilder’s grasp in February\r\nEver since shifting the pounds, eating the right food and remaining in the gym have become crucial for the 32-year-old from Morecambe – regardless of whether or not he has a fight.\r\n\r\nHowever, even the most dedicated bodybuilder likes to enjoy a cheeky cheat day or two just to retain a little bit of sanity when they are not meticulously counting calories.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to LadBible about the release of his new book, The Furious Method: Transform your Mind, Body and Goals, the WBC heavyweight champion admitted he likes to gorge on as much as he can when not preparing for a world title fight.\r\n\r\n“It was the heavyweight champion of takeaways!” Fury said about ordering £557 worth of pizza during the first coronavirus lockdown.\r\n\r\nFury’s weight ballooned as he battled mental health problems\r\n\r\nITV\r\n3\r\nFury’s weight ballooned as he battled mental health problems\r\n“I just kept eating until I couldn’t eat any more.

Pressure him early and beat him up.\r\n\r\n“He won’t do it, but I would encourage him to fight in his natural southpaw stance. He’s a beast as a southpaw.\r\n\r\n“Joshua’s best chance to win is by using his boxing skills since they are better than Tyson’s. Anthony must dictate the pace and stay off the ropes.\r\n\r\n“For both, distance will be important.

And while exactly how much Mayweather was paid is debated – with some insisting it was around the $20million region – there’s no doubt he made a pretty penny.\r\n\r\nSo of course, WWE managed to find the funny side of his latest announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again, Mayweather can see the money in facing Paul like he did when he came up against McGregor.\r\n\r\nPaul’s 22 million strong YouTube following is the same reason Eddie Hearn promoted his sole professional fight with another YouTuber, KSI.\r\n\r\nBut UFC president Dana White thinks the whole event is laughable.\r\n\r\n“When people ask me what’s the state of boxing right now, that’s where it’s at,” White said.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t that kid get beat up by the f*****g video game kid from England and now he’s going to fight Floyd Mayweather?”\r\n\r\nFor his part, Paul genuinely believes he would beat up Mayweather in virtually any setting – with a boxing ring perhaps the only exception.\r\n\r\nFloyd Mayweather made a pretty penny working with WWE\r\n\r\n4\r\nFloyd Mayweather made a pretty penny working with WWE\r\nThe 25-year-old told TMZ in November: “Let me tell you this, if I caught Floyd in a real fight, street fight, whoop his a**e! No question.\r\n\r\n“MMA? Octagon? Whoop his a**e!” The only place I think Floyd is safe obviously is the boxing ring, but to be honest, I don’t give a f**k!

We won 2-0 away at their ground and took all three points so for that reason we have a great chance of finishing first in the group.\r\n\r\n“We are missing important players. We will have to look to do the best we can, both technically and tactically, as well as being fresh. Against Juventus we will put out a strong side because we want to finish first in the group.\r\n\r\n“In our attack, Leo Messi is very important. A lot of attacking play comes from him. He is the best in the world and I don’t think he has made many mistakes defending. It is the work of the whole team to be more aggressive in defence and to be more effective.\r\n\r\n“It’s great that Messi and Cristiano are at the top level. They have had a lot of success over the last few years. They are two different players but they have amazing scoring records. They are both players to admire.”\r\n\r\nJuventus boss Andrea Pirlo: “This match is especially important for our growth and self-esteem. Coming first is important, but what we put in on the pitch is even more important.\r\n\r\n“Compared to the first game, we need to improve the non-possession phase and be closer to the midfield and defensive lines. In the derby we had a completely different attitude between the first and second half, winning all the duels. This is the attitude that is part of Juve’s DNA and must never be missing.\r\n\r\n“It would be wrong to say who is better between Messi and Cristiano. They are two phenomenons that put-on spectacles for millions of fans. We just have to thank them.\r\n\r\n“It’s a period where many great players struggle, it’s normal. The great players have had little time to rest and were immediately busy with their national teams. Everything will be more normal after Christmas.\r\n\r\n“If Cristiano is in good form it means that he is in the right place at the right time and we are good at giving him the ball.” \r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./205.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Allsport5.component.js",["556","557"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Allsport5.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                            <h1>              Former Porto and Brazil striker Hulk could secure a long-awaited move to the Premier League after officially confirming his departure from Shanghai SIPG following the club’s Asian Champions League elimination on Monday.\r\n </h1><p>\r\n\r\nThe 34-year-old forward is available on a free transfer in January after rejecting a lucrative new deal to remain in China earlier this year.\r\n\r\nHulk is currently assessing his options as he gets set for a new chapter in football\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n2\r\nHulk is currently assessing his options as he gets set for a new chapter in football\r\nConfirming his exit on Instagram, Hulk wrote: “Today I leave Shanghai SIPG, a team that has offered me a warm welcome.\r\n\r\n“I am very happy for everything the fans have given me these four years.

Man United are always under the magnifying glass, even though every top six club has problems.\r\n\r\n“If you take the best two players out of every team, they will struggle, and you could see how much United are relying on Bruno Fernandes to get a performance.\r\n\r\nPlay Video\r\nAlly McCoist criticses the timing of Mino Raiola's Pogba bombshell and accuses agent of 'selfishness'\r\n“As soon as he isn’t there, they fall into a slow, pedestrian pace, with no runs in behind and no penetration.”\r\n\r\n“If you want to win trophies and leagues, you need to be consistent.

Everyone’s got different opinions on how to express their intolerance and it’s important they do that.\r\n\r\n“There will be a banner which will send out a very powerful message from the two clubs – QPR and Millwall – and there will be a short break before kick-off and if players want to take the knee, that’ll be their call.\r\n\r\n“They’re professional athletes, both teams have had some good performances but not got the rewards in recent games, it’s a big fixture for both QPR and Millwall.”\r\n\r\nWith so much surrounding the pre-match events, it’s difficult to remember that a London derby with lots riding on it will get under way once the whistle goes.\r\n\r\nAnd Warburton insists that while it doesn’t dilute the seriousness of what will happen before the game, his players must try to focus on performing.\r\n\r\nPlay Video\r\nTroy Townsend describes 'despair' at Millwall fans booing players taking the knee and questions how much progress is really being made in eradicating racial inequality\r\nHe added: “The focus has to be on football, they’re professional competitors. They’re very well aware of what happened and they’re very well aware of the bigger picture.\r\n\r\n“But they’ve got to make sure they do the right thing up to the first whistle, then the focus has to be on the football.”\r\n\r\n“It has to be, but please don’t think I’m diluting the importance of this matter. It quite rightly received national headlines, because we cannot allow this in society, football has a key role to play in this area so it’s really important to send out these messages.” \r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./216.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Allsport1.component.js",["564","565"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Allsport1.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                    <h6> It’s not done yet, but Paul Pogba is now all but out of the door at Manchester United with a transfer in January a real possibility.\r\n\r\nAfter returning for a world-record £89million fee in 2016, the Frenchman is now set to quit Old Trafford in pursuit of the happiness he never truly found in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months</h6> <p>\r\n                        \r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n8\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months\r\nAfter a spell on the bench under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola told Tuttosport: “I can say it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.\r\n\r\n“There’s no use ignoring it. It’s better to speak honestly, look to the future and not waste time trying to blame people: Paul is unhappy at Manchester United, he can no longer express himself as he wants to or in the way that’s expected of him.\r\n\r\n“He needs to change team, he needs a change of scene. He has a contract that expires in a year and a half’s time, in the summer of 2022, but I think the best solution would be for him to leave in the next transfer window.\r\n\r\n“Otherwise the club from Old Trafford, with whom he has a good relationship, know very well that they risk losing him on a free transfer, considering that right now he does not want to extend his deal.\r\n\r\nPlay Video\r\nJamie O'Hara's passionate rant on football agent Mino Raiola after he drops Pogba bombshell - he's egotistical and it's all about him - just shut up mate!\r\n“If people don’t get that, they know very little about football. In any case, they’ll all blame me if Paul leaves next summer.”\r\n\r\nSolskjaer has been coping well without Pogba in recent weeks, using Fred and Scott McTominay to give the Red Devils a sturdier base in midfield, although the 27-year-old did perform well when he started against West Ham, scoring a superb equaliser.\r\n\r\nHe won’t be sold cheap and United will need the money to go out and acquire a replacement but with Donny van de Beek signed in the summer, Bruno Fernandes the star of the show in attacking midfield, and Nemanja Matic now 32, it’s likely any incoming player could be more defensively minded.\r\n\r\nPogba scored a superb goal against West Ham on Saturday\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n8\r\nPogba scored a superb goal against West Ham on Saturday\r\nGiven Solskjaer’s tactics it’s also probable, we’ll see a player with the capability to switch play to the wings quickly and with tremendous precision with their quick counters often ending in goals.\r\n\r\nIt also takes the heat off creator-in-chief Fernandes who is too relied upon by United, as shown in the first half against West Ham at the weekend.\r\n\r\nAlthough the odd attacking midfielder will certainly be on the menu for United, particularly if a swap deal is the only way they can be rid of their wantaway star.\r\n\r\nBut who are the men the Old Trafford might target to replace Pogba and strengthen their top four credentials? talkSPORT.com takes a look.\r\n\r\nSolskjaer will surely use the funds to improve his midfield after losing the Frenchman\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n8\r\nSolskjaer will surely use the funds to improve his midfield after losing the Frenchman\r\nKalvin Phillips (Leeds)\r\nWe will get this one out of the way early doors as, let’s face it, nabbing a player from their rivals is quite unlikely.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Manchester United, he would be an excellent solution to the problems they have in midfield.\r\n\r\nNot only does Phillips offer protection in front of the back line, the 25-year-old is one of the Premier League’s top tacklers and all despite him missing a couple of games with injury. While being safe in possession with short and medium range passes, he ranks 14th for passes into the final third with 55, while he’s also in the top 30 for progressive passes, so he’s certainly forward thinking with the ball.\r\n\r\nThe fact he loves his hometown club, though, would make any potential transfer hard to happen, but let’s not rule it out completely.\r\n\r\nPhillips has earned the nickname the ‘Yorkshire Pirlo’ but his playing style is far more all-action than the Italian’s\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n8\r\nPhillips has earned the nickname the ‘Yorkshire Pirlo’ but his playing style is far more all-action than the Italian’s\r\nDeclan Rice (West Ham)\r\nThe England international has mostly been linked with a return to Chelsea, the club where he played as a youth, and the home of best mate Mason Mount.\r\n\r\nWith N’Golo Kane getting back to his best in the centre of a midfield three, though, it’s less likely the Blues can so wantonly splash the cash on another player after their summer spending.\r\n\r\nThis allows United to creep in and nab the ever-improving midfielder, who is still only 21, and bolster their squad.\r\n\r\nAn effective shield in front of a back-three at the London Stadium, he’s now far better in possession and is currently averaging more passes into the penalty area than ever before with 0.73 per game compared to 0.47 last term, while he’s also playing more switches and crosses.\r\n\r\nA diminished defensive output, though, can be pinned on the change in formation by David Moyes, making the Hammers more solid and the shrewd addition of Czechia ace Tomas Soucek, who has been a revelation in midfielder alongside Rice.\r\n\r\nDeclan Rice in action for West Ham against Aston Villa\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n8\r\nRice continues to impress for the Hammers and is now a regular at international level with England\r\nPaulo Dybala (Juventus)\r\nAlmost two years after nearly joining a Premier League club with both United and Tottenham attempting to land him, the Argentine could finally reach Old Trafford.\r\n\r\nWith Edinson Cavani only signing a one-year deal, with an option for another, and Odion Ighalo’s loan set to expire, another attacking force coming in could be how Pogba is replaced.\r\n\r\nNot only that, it could be in a direct swap deal with the Frenchman rejoining his old club, who are now managed by his former teammate Andrea Pirlo.\r\n\r\nLast year, Dybala was back on form in Serie A but this term his performances have dipped again with no goals or assists in four starts and two substitute appearances for Juve.\r\n\r\nHe was, though, much improved in the Turin derby last weekend but after five-and-a-half seasons he may well fancy a change of scene just like Pogba.\r\n\r\nJuventus star

over the last couple of years but on his day there is no doubting his talent\r\nEduardo Camavinga (Rennes)\r\nIf you’re going to invest money you get for Pogba, why not put it into one of the most talented young midfielders in Europe?\r\n\r\nWith a superb passing range already, whether it be long raking efforts, or the simple stuff, he’s exceptional with the ball at his feet for someone who is just 18 years old.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year he became the second youngest goalscorer for France and starred against Ukraine on his full debut.\r\n\r\nLast season he posted up superb defensive numbers for Rennes as they made it into the Champions League, building a reputation for fine tackling, but he’s also a fine technician and capable of dribbling forward.\r\n\r\nHe could be utilised as a 6 or an 8 for United going forward, although as he acclimatises the latter is more likely to begin with.\r\n\r\nRennes wonderkid Eduardo Camavinga\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n8\r\nCamavinga is already looking like being on his way to becoming an elite talent\r\nWilfred Ndidi (Leicester City)\r\nAn injury hit him at the end of last season but prior to that the Nigerian was one of the best defensive midfielders around and now he’s returning for the Foxes and about to take up his role at the heart of their team again.\r\n\r\nStacking up tackles and interceptions like a man possessed, the 23-year-old – yes, he is only 23 – has been sensational since a move from Genk in 2017.\r\n\r\nLike Rice, he’s also improved with his forward thinking and his pass success rate has grown season-on-season, while he has Champions League experience with Leicester.\r\n\r\nHaving Ndidi in the centre of the pitch, ahead of ex-teammate Harry Maguire and alongside Aaron Wan-Bissaka will make United formidable opponents, while allowing Fernandes to continue his thrilling offensive contributions.\r\n\r\nLeicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n8\r\nNdidi is

reverse fixture played at Old Trafford in October, when Marcus Rashford hit a hat-trick as United thrashed their German opponents 5-0.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HOUR AGO8th December 2020\r\nIt’s all or nothing

course, will send them through, and a draw is enough due to their head-to-head record with the Germans, but defeat, even if Group H rivals Paris Saint-Germain lose to Istanbul Basaksehir, will see them crash out.\r\n\r\ntalkSPORT brings you full LIVE commentary of the huge European clash, but how will the Red Devils line-up in Germany?\r\n\r\nWe have taken a look at the latest team news and predicted the Manchester United XI, HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nFrank Lampard has brushed off Jurgen Klopp’s suggestions that Chelsea are favourites for the Premier League, insisting Liverpool and Manchester City are still the front-runners for the title.\r\n\r\nThe Reds’ attempts to defend their crown has been dealt repeated blows with a hefty injury list besieged on the reigning champions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Klopp’s side remain in second place and level on points with leaders Tottenham.\r\n\r\nChelsea sit third and are now unbeaten in nine league games, with Klopp having hailed the Blues’ ‘unbelievable’ squad strength when marking out Lampard’s men for glory.\r\n\r\nStamford Bridge boss Lampard was quick to shake off Klopp’s tip, however, insisting his third-place Blues remain a work in progress after their £220million summer recruitment drive.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure anyone actually really went for it,” said Lampard, of Klopp making Chelsea favourites for the title.\r\n\r\n“I think Liverpool and Manchester City seem to be pretty much everyone’s favourites, when they perform the way they have in the last three years, building up the squads they have over the last few years. Quite rightly so.\r\n\r\n“Even with injuries you look at Liverpool’s squad, the team they put out last night (against Wolves), they cope with those injuries. They have a big squad and most teams in the Premier League do.\r\n\r\n“Tottenham are in the equation, so are Manchester United and so are others at this point. It’s very tight.”\r\n\r\nREAD MORE HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nArsenal outcast Mesut Ozil has fired back at Piers Morgan as their war of words continues on Twitter.\r\n\r\nOzil was left out of Arsenal’s 25-man Premier League squad for the first half of the 2020/21 season, but the Germany playmaker has remained very vocal on social media in support of his teammates.\r\n\r\nAnd many Arsenal fans still appear to back Ozil, especially now Mikel Arteta’s side are struggling on the pitch and could really do with a top-class playmaker to create goalscoring chances.\r\n\r\nThere have been many calls to ‘freeozil’ on social media, and the German showed his thanks for those supporting him on Twitter on Monday.\r\n\r\nHe captioned a photo of him in front of fans at the Emirates: “The feeling of having fans behind you… grateful bestfans hardtimes.”\r\n\r\nBut Morgan, the outspoken Gooner who has long criticised Ozil, was not buying into the sentiment.\r\n\r\nHe replied to Ozil’s tweet: “Real Arsenal fans aren’t behind you. You’re our Paul Pogba – massively overpaid, massively under-performing & shockingly overinflated sense of your own importance. truth.”\r\n\r\nOzil, who earns a whopping £350,000-per-week at the Emirates, hit back in typically ruthless fashion.\r\n\r\nHe replied: “Piers, buddy, are you still bitter from the other day? It seems like you’re not a big fan of World Champions.\r\n\r\n“I wish you would see as good as you hear things.”\r\n\r\nFULL STORY HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nMarseille boss Andre Villas-Boas believes Manchester City are good enough to win the Champions League with their 'B' team.\r\n\r\nThe French side are expecting to find out just how strong City's so-called second string can be when the clubs meet at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nHaving already secured a place in the Champions League last 16, City manager Pep Guardiola has suggested he will make wholesale changes for the Group C encounter.\r\n\r\nPorto have already taken the runners-up spot in the pool but the game is still important for Marseille as they look to pip Olympiacos to the consolation of a Europa League place.\r\n\r\nVillas-Boas, the former Chelsea and Tottenham manager, said: “Qualifying is not in our hands.\r\n\r\n“Hopefully Porto will do us a favour but we know it is going to be hard against Manchester City. They have so many options, and so many top-level options as well.\r\n\r\n“We cannot rely on Porto but we must be at our best to get a positive result because City's 'B' team are strong enough to win the Champions League, I think.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nManchester United fans have expressed widespread disdain for Paul Pogba after his agent Mino Raiola’s latest comments – and many have phoned talkSPORT saying it’s time to sell the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nHowever, none took it quite so far as Chris the Red Devils supporter, who wants Pogba loaned out to Joey Barton’s League One side Fleetwood Town!\r\n\r\nHe told the Breakfast show: “What an idiot [Raiola]! Nobody is going to take Pogba, nobody!\r\n\r\n“What manager is going to take him? They’ll be looking over their shoulder all the time.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t pick him in the team, is he going to go to the press? We’ve got a big elephant in the room that we don’t want.”\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, Chris suggests Man United should cut their losses and loan Pogba out to Barton at Fleetwood.\r\n\r\nBecause, well, why not?\r\n\r\n“The team are better without him. Loan him out to Joey Barton!” Chris added.\r\n\r\n“Whether we get money for him or not, just get him out. If anybody wanted him, they would’ve come for him in the summer.\r\n\r\n“Nobody wants him because nobody wants the headache of his agent.”\r\n\r\nFULL STORY HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./202.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       5 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has not made a decision on what side to pick for the Champions League dead rubber against Midtjylland but insists he still wants to win the match.\r\n\r\nWith the Reds already qualified as Group D winners, Klopp has the rare luxury of resting some of his over-worked senior players – Andy Robertson has played every minute of every Premier League match this season, for example – and offering more chances to youngsters.\r\n\r\nBut Klopp said there was still a burden of responsibility on him and the club to be competitive.\r\n\r\n“Our Champions League squad was really already very young, we have had four, five, six players involved in the squad so far and yes they will travel and then we will make decisions,” he said.\r\n\r\n“The analysis is not finalised yet and they will all play a part in my my thinking. It is the first time we don't have to get a result in the last match of the group stage and so we have to consider the general situation, that's clear, but we have to consider we are Liverpool and we want to win the game.\r\n\r\n“All these things will lead to a line-up.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nArsenal and Tottenham are considering a January move for AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie, reports claim.\r\n\r\nThe Ivory Coast international has been instrumental in the Rossoneri’s superb start to the season, forming an imperious partnership with Ismael Bennacer in the midfield as the seven-time European champions sit top of the Serie A standings.\r\n\r\nReports in Italy say that Milan are taking steps to secure the renewal of Kessie, whose current contract is set to expire in June 2022.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to Calciomercato, the 23-year-old is attracting interest from north London duo Arsenal and Spurs.\r\n\r\nREAD MORE HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nManchester United could sign Paulo Dybala in a swap deal for Paul Pogba, reports claim.\r\n\r\nPogba's future has once again become a huge talking point as his agent, Mino Raiola, said the midfielder is 'unhappy' at Old Trafford with his time in Manchester 'over'.\r\n\r\nA January transfer has been mooted with PSG, Real Madrid and Pogba's former club Juventus all keen on the France international.\r\n\r\nAnd, according to the Daily Mail, Dybala is a long-term target of United's and could be made available for transfer, which has increased chances of a swap deal.\r\n\r\nJuve are allegedly ready to cash in on Dybala and earlier this week reports emerged claiming he has been offered to each of the Premier League's Big Six clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nLeeds defender Robin Koch will undergo surgery on the knee injury sustained in Saturday's Premier League defeat to Chelsea.\r\n\r\nKoch had been nursing a knee problem since his debut against Liverpool, and after his latest setback he will face some time on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nLeeds confirmed in a statement: “Unfortunately, following a collision in the Chelsea game, he suffered further damage to his knee and the club have made the decision that surgery is required to remedy the problem.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nNewcastle's players will return to training on Tuesday following the postponement of their game against Aston Villa last week due to a rise in Covid-19 cases.\r\n\r\nUnited's Darsley Park training headquarters had been closed as a result of the spike, which led to the first Premier League fixture this season to be postponed due to the pandemic.\r\n\r\nThe Magpies were due to head for Villa Park on Friday evening, but were granted permission to reschedule the fixture.\r\n\r\nIn a statement on Twitter, the Premier League club wrote: “United's players will train at the Training Centre today following a temporary closure last week due to a rise in Covid-19 cases.\r\n\r\n“Those who had tested positive will follow relevant protocols before returning. Thanks for your messages of support to our players and staff.”\r\n\r\nPlayers and staff who were tested on Sunday have since undergone another round of checks as medics work to identify the source of the outbreak, with the return of squad members to Tyneside following last month's international break understood to be a focus.\r\n\r\nNewcastle, who are due to face West Brom at St James' Park on Saturday, have not identified those affected or confirmed the number of cases amid speculation that the outbreak may have reached double figures.\r\n\r\n7 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nMino Raiola has been told to ‘shut up and let Paul Pogba play football’ by former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara.\r\n\r\nPogba’s name was all over the back pages this morning after the Frenchman’s agent publicly announced his time at Old Trafford is ‘over’. With all eyes on United’s must-draw Champions League match against RB Leipzig – which is LIVE on talkSPORT on Tuesday night – Raiola seized the opportunity to put his client up for sale yet again, despite little transfer speculation and a return to form for Pobga over the weekend.\r\n\r\nEven still, Raiola’s comments do not come as too much of a surprise, given his outspoken nature.\r\n\r\nAnd O’Hara is quite frankly sick of it.\r\n\r\n“He’s all about himself, making a name for himself and bigging himself up,” O’Hara told Tuesday’s talkSPORT Breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got this player, I can end FIFA, Pogba’s finished – just shut up, mate!\r\n\r\n“Seriously, if he was my agent, I would phone him up and say, ‘Keep you mouth shut, I’m playing for Manchester United, I’m not playing well, I’ve just scored on the weekend and now I’m thrown all over the papers again’.”\r\n\r\nREAD MORE HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nThree-time Serie A winner Mario Balotelli has completed a move to Italian second-tier side Monza where he will link up with former Milan teammate Kevin-Prince Boateng.\r\n\r\nThe signing also sees the 30-year-old striker reunited with ex-Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, who is overseeing an ambitious project at the Serie B outfit.\r\n\r\nThe former Manchester City and Liverpool striker, who has been without a club since leaving Brescia earlier this summer, has signed a short-term deal until the end of the season.\r\n\r\nThe Italian recently trained with Serie D side Franciacorta in November and was also linked with Championship club Barnsley.\r\n\r\nHe told Gazzetta dello Sport: “I thank the president [Silvio] Berlusconi and Adriano Galliani for this opportunity. I will do everything to help Monza reach Serie A.”\r\n\r\nFULL STORY HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nFrank Lampard has backed Kai Havertz to realise his “top-class” potential at Chelsea now he is putting his coronavirus illness behind him.\r\n\r\nHavertz missed several weeks of the campaign after testing positive for Covid-19, with Lampard now revealing the condition took a greater toll on the Germany playmaker than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe 21-year-old has yet to find top form over a sustained spell since joining the Blues in a £70million summer switch from Bayer Leverkusen, but Lampard has tipped Havertz to become of the world's best players in his time at Stamford Bridge.\r\n\r\n“Kai is fitting in really well, I said it before but I want to make it clear that he had strong symptoms of Covid,” Lampard said ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Krasnodar.\r\n\r\n“He was very ill and struggling for a while and not all players have it like that, some are symptom-free.\r\n\r\n“I had to factor that in so that's why it took two or three weeks before he is starting a game again after he returned from Covid.\r\n\r\n“Before he fell ill and turned in a positive test, I thought his form was fantastic.\r\n\r\n“He played some really good stuff in the number eight role, the advanced midfield role and I was delighted for him. You could see he was enjoying it, but Covid cut that short.\r\n\r\n“Long term, I have no concerns. In fact, I feel quite the opposite. He is going to be a huge player for this football club, in the Premier League, as he has all the attributes and attitude to be an absolutely top-class player for the league and in the world.\r\n\r\n“That's how highly I rate him and I think people that analyse him, it can be quick reactions at times involving price tags and so on.\r\n\r\n“But I think we have to understand that some of the best players that have come to this country have found it quite hard for some time to get used to the Premier League and I think Kai has actually been very good.\r\n\r\n“Covid has made it difficult for him but he is a top player and will be a top player for us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nAlly McCoist laid into Paul Pogba's agent Mino Raiola after he told the press on Monday that the midfielder is unhappy at Manchester United.\r\n\r\nPogba's future has once again come into doubt with a host of clubs, including PSG, Real Madrid and Juventus, long-term admirers of the France international.\r\n\r\nRaiola said it's 'over' for Pogba with many now believing the midfielder will leave Old Trafford – either in the January transfer window or next summer.\r\n\r\nThe agent has been widely criticised for speaking out, rather than Pogba doing so himself – especially as Raiola's quotes came just one day ahead of a crunch Champions League clash with RB Leipzig and with the Manchester derby to follow at the weekend.\r\n\r\n“The timing is shocking, and at the very best it's selfish,” said Ally as he joined those voicing their criticism of Raiola.\r\n\r\n“I actually had to laugh at the bit about Paul being unhappy. I know one or two Man United fans who are quite unhappy with Paul!\r\n\r\n“Who does he think he is coming out with that at this point in time?\r\n\r\n“If his contract expires in a year and a half, this probably is the best moment in time to sell him, because his value will be decreasing. \r\n\r\n“I don't think the move has been a very talented player, he's won a World Cup, but he's not really hit it at Man United.\r\n\r\n“Ole clearly prefers Fred and McTominay in the holding positions in the middle of the park. He's not going to play before Fernandes.\r\n\r\n“The timing is just so selfish, Man United and Solskjaer have got a massive game tonight, absolutely massive, a game they cannot afford to lose, and he's coming out with this nonsense. \r\n\r\n“If you dissect what it does say, I don't necessarily disagree that Pogba should go in January.”\r\n\r\n\r\n9 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nAlly McCoist has hit out at VAR once again following the latest drama involving the technology in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nBrighton lost to Southampton on Monday night with Saints' late winner coming from the penalty spot.\r\n\r\nThe spot kick was awarded after a VAR review, as referee David Coote had initially given Southampton a free-kick for Solly March's challenge on Kyle Walker-Peters.\r\n\r\nVAR decided the challenge happened inside the area, despite many critics believing the tackle quite clearly occurred outside the area.\r\n\r\nAnd Ally, being one of those critics, again ranted about the technology on Tuesday's talkSPORT Breakfast.\r\n\r\n“It's not a penalty, it's a free-kick at the edge of the box,” said the Rangers legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It's a foul outside the box, free-kick, referee was right, two minutes of everybody's life we will never get back. Take the free-kick, get on with the game – end of.\r\n\r\n“That's it.\r\n\r\n“I mean, it's a free-kick… and then you watch it and it's still a free-kick!\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you something else: the players were absolutely spot on, and that must have been really difficult because they were actually watching it and they all know it's a free-kick outside the box, and they give a penalty.\r\n\r\n“How many times, in all seriousness, have I said to you in the last two or three weeks about 'clear and obvious'?”\r\n\r\n\r\n9 HOURS AGO8th December 2020\r\nA Manchester United fan has told talkSPORT he wants to get rid of Paul Pogba… and sign Mesut Ozil on a free transfer.\r\n\r\nThe France midfielder's agent, Mino Raiola, came out on Monday and said it's 'over' for Pogba at United to once again cast doubts over his future.\r\n\r\nReal Madrid, PSG and Juventus have all been linked with Pogba over the past few years, and could he finally be nearing the end of his time at Old Trafford?\r\n\r\nWell, one United fan – Barry – joined talkSPORT on Monday and said he'd gladly get rid of Pogba – with Arsenal outcast Ozil the perfect signing to replace him with.\r\n\r\n“I don't know whether he is happy or unhappy because he never actually tells us himself,” began Barry on Drive.\r\n\r\n“But I would say he should come out and say 'I want to stay' or 'I don't want to stay, and I want to go'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“And I would let him go and get the £100million.\r\n\r\n“And I am just throwing one in at you, because I think [Jose] Mourinho might try to sign him [for Spurs] – Mesut Ozil, maybe on a free.\r\n\r\n“I would throw him in at United as a creative player, and get rid of Fred and Martial.\r\n\r\n“I think Ozil would be a good signing for United and I think him and Van de Beek and Fernandes would gel quite well.\r\n\r\n“I know he's not a grafter – everybody knows that – but he's just got that spark and quality that we need; maybe what Pogba has got but doesn't quite show us often enough.”\r\n\r\n\r\n18 HOURS AGO7th December 2020\r\nFrank Lampard insists he is under no pressure to sell out-of-favour Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\r\n\r\nLampard revealed the Spain international will start Tuesday's dead-rubber Champions League clash with Krasnodar at Stamford Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe 26-year-old will make his first appearance since October, having slipped out of the team following Edouard Mendy's £20million arrival from Rennes.\r\n\r\nKepa became a £71million world-record signing for a goalkeeper when joining Chelsea from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, but has failed to convince at Stamford Bridge and especially under Lampard.\r\n\r\nLampard has previously admitted Kepa was struggling with his confidence and form, but Chelsea have already won Group E leaving Tuesday's clash the ideal opportunity to rotate resources.\r\n\r\nChelsea could reasonably seek to cut any losses on Kepa, but Lampard insisted the club's board have made no such moves.\r\n\r\nAsked if he is under any pressure to move Kepa on, Lampard said: “No, there's no pressure. The pressure, and I'm not saying this has been spoken about, is to win games.\r\n\r\n“I have to do the right thing game by game of course. And Mendy has made himself a permanent fixture at this point.\r\n\r\n“Because the pressure to win games means I pick people in form, goalkeeper, striker, winger, whoever.\r\n\r\n“But at the same time with the game tomorrow it's obviously an opportunity to give Edou a rest and Kepa a game; he's been training well and he deserves it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19 HOURS AGO7th December 2020\r\nVAR took centre stage again as the Brighton players were furious when a penalty was awarded to Southampton on Monday night.\r\n\r\nReferee David Coote gave a free-kick the Saints’ way just outside the box when Solly March fouled Kyle Walker-Peters in the 77th minute.\r\n\r\nThere were no questions about whether it was a foul but there were some doubts about whether it happened in or outside the box.\r\n\r\nVAR stepped in and after a lengthy delay decided that it had taken place inside the box and a penalty was duly awarded, much to the anger of the Seagulls players.\r\n\r\nThe game was finely balanced at 1-1 at the time and Danny Ings stepped up and made no mistake from the spot to make it 2-1.\r\n\r\nFULL STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20 HOURS AGO7th December 2020\r\nCeltic have given manager Neil Lennon their public backing for a second week running.\r\n\r\nFurther protests followed Sunday's 1-1 home draw with St Johnstone as Celtic went five games without a win but Lennon will remain in charge.\r\n\r\nA club statement read: “In light of the ongoing speculation regarding the position of our football manager, Neil Lennon, the board of Celtic Football Club wishes to make clear its continuing support for Neil and his backroom team.\r\n\r\n“The board recognises and understands the importance of winning the league championship this season and that, as Neil himself has made clear, recent performances and results have been disappointing.\r\n\r\n“The board is committed to delivering success for Celtic supporters.”\r\n\r\n21 HOURS AGO7th December 2020\r\nHarry Maguire is in a confident mood ahead of Manchester United’s crucial Champions League clash at RB Leipzig.\r\n\r\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are level on nine points with Tuesday’s hosts and last season’s finalists Paris Saint-Germain.\r\n\r\nUnited will seal their place in the round of 16 if they avoid defeat to Leipzig, but a return to Europa League action awaits in 2021 should they falter against a side thumped 5-0 at Old Trafford in October.\r\n\r\nAsked if it was unacceptable for a club of such stature to fail to get out of the group, United captain Maguire said: “Well, of course we expect to go through in the group.\r\n\r\n“Whatever teams you put in our group, any four teams, we expect to go through.”\r\n\r\nFULL STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21 HOURS AGO7th December 2020\r\nManchester City have announced defender Taylor Harwood-Bellis has signed a new four-year contract extension.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old City academy product was handed his first-team debut in September 2019 and has made six senior appearances in total, all in cup competitions.\r\n\r\nHe scored his maiden goal in a 4-1 FA Cup win against Port Vale at the Etihad Stadium in January.\r\n\r\nRegarding the deal to 2024, Harwood-Bellis told CityTV: “This is a dream come true for me and my family. I've been at City since I was young and I love this football club.\r\n\r\n“To have played for the first team was the culmination of so much hard work, and this new contract feels like the next big step in my career.\r\n\r\n“The club have given me so much and I want to thank them. So many coaches across the academy have helped me become the player I am today and now Pep (Guardiola) and his staff are helping me to improve.\r\n\r\n“The confidence Pep has placed in me makes me feel like anything is possible, and the work he and his staff do on the training field is making me a better defender.\r\n\r\n“I am happy with my progress. I am at the right place to keep improving and developing.\r\n\r\n“I'm just so glad this contract is all sorted because it now means I can concentrate on improving further and achieving my goals.”\r\n\r\nA DAY AGO7th December 2020\r\nPaul Pogba is 'unhappy' at Manchester United according to his agent Mino Raiola.\r\n\r\nThe Italian has given an explosive interview with Tuttosport and claimed Pogba's time at United was 'over'.\r\n\r\nHe said: “Paul is unhappy with Man United as he is no longer able to express himself in the way that he would like and as he is expected to. Paul needs a new team, a change of air. He is under contract for the next 18 months and it will expire in the summer of 2022.\r\n\r\n“However, I think that the best solution for both Pogba and Man Utd is that he goes in the next transfer window. If not, the Old Trafford club know that they risk losing him on a free transfer as it is not Paul's intention to extend his contract.\r\n\r\n“Manchester United board know the risk losing Pogba for free given the player has no intention of extending. If somebody does not understand that, then they do not understand football. In any case, let them blame me if Paul leaves.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AGO7th December 2020\r\nEngland must face one of the best strikers in world football on their road to qualifying for the Qatar World Cup in 2022.\r\n\r\nThe draw was made for the qualifying group stages on Monday afternoon, with matches set to be played between March and November next year.\r\n\r\nGareth Southgate’s side were drawn against familiar foe Poland, who count Robert Lewandowski among their ranks.\r\n\r\nLewandowski has arguably been the best footballer in the world in 2020 helping Bayern Munich to the treble last season and was a strong favourite for the Ballon d’Or before the decision was made to cancel it.\r\n\r\nThe Poles have faced the Three Lions in qualifying for the 1974, 1990, 1994, 2006 and 2014 World Cups, as well as taking on England in the finals in Mexico in 1986.\r\n\r\nFULL STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AGO7th December 2020\r\nEngland have been drawn against Poland, Hungary, Albania, Andorra and San Marino in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup.\r\n\r\nThe draw was made this afternoon with the other Home Nations also learning who they will need to beat in order to qualify for the tournament in Qatar.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland have been drawn against Italy, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Lithuania, Wales will face Belgium, the Czech Republic, Belarus and Estonia, and Scotland will play Denmark, Austria, Israel, the Faroe Islands and Moldova.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./203.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Basketball1.component.js",["568","569"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Basketball1.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

I know Vanessa [Bryant is] proud of us, the organisation’s proud of us. It means a lot to us.”\r\n\r\nBryant is one of the greatest players to ever play the game, especially offensively. He’s remembered for his work ethic and powerful desire to win and his death seemed to galvanise the Lakers and catapult them to glory this year.\r\n\r\nLeBron finished with his fourth Finals MVP award and he and Davis became the first duo to average over 25 points a game in the NBA Finals since another iconic duo that wore the Purple and Gold – Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant.\r\n\r\nKobe Bryant and LeBron James shared the court many times\r\n\r\n2\r\nKobe Bryant and LeBron James shared the court many time \r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./220.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Basketball3.component.js",["572","573"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Basketball3.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                     <h1>NUMBER 17 LA Lakers send fans wild with NBA Championship win against Miami Heat 4-2 – LeBron James calls for respect, Anthony Davis dedicates victory to Kobe Bryant\r\n</h1> <p>\r\n                        \r\nBy Alex McCarthy\r\n12th October 2020, 11:36 am\r\nThe LA Lakers won their first NBA championship in 10 years on Sunday as they defeated the Miami Heat 106-93 to win the NBA Finals 4-2.\r\n\r\nLeBron James was the star of the show once more as his triple-double of 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists led the Lakers to clinch the series in six games.

But you don’t actually know Dennis Rodman,” the former Bulls star said about himself, on episode three of Netflix’s The Last Dance.\r\n\r\n“They just see what they see on the court and see what they read in the papers. They think he’s a bad person.\r\n\r\n“Nobody can say anything bad about me as a teammate.\r\n\r\n“You have the great Michael Jordan. You have the great Scottie Pippen. You have the great [coach] Phil Jackson. But if you take me away from this team, do they still win a championship? I don’t think so.”\r\n\r\nThe Bulls won six titles in the 90s, beginning with the first three-peat happening between 1991 and 1993 and the second between 1996 and 1998\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./225.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       NBA CLASSIC - GETTY\r\n4\r\nThe Bulls won six titles in the 90s, beginning with the first three-peat happening between 1991 and 1993 and the second between 1996 and 1998\r\nJackson said Rodman held the team together, while Jordan acknowledges his teammate carried the team at times in a way he couldn’t.\r\n\r\n“Dennis was a model citizen to the point where it was driving him f***ing insane,” Jordan explained in the third episode.\r\n\r\nAnd so when Pippen returned from injury, Rodman felt he needed a holiday and coach Jackson, who always treated his mercurial star as a special case, reluctantly agreed.\r\n\r\nHe was given 48 hours off and swapped the Windy City for Sin City with Electra in tow. Unsurprisingly, he didn’t return on time.\r\n\r\n“We had to get his ass out of bed,” Jordan recalled laughing.\r\n\r\nElectra said being Rodman’s girlfriend was ‘definitely an occupational hazard’\r\n\r\n4\r\nElectra said being Rodman’s girlfriend was ‘definitely an occupational hazard’\r\nThe most famous sportsman on the planet travelled to Vegas to literally bang on his bedroom door and wake him up as Electra hid.\r\n\r\n“I do remember being in Vegas with [Dennis],” she said.\r\n\r\n“The party was starting right away. One thing about Dennis, he had to escape. He liked to go out. He liked to go to clubs. We’d go to his favourite restaurant. Then we’d go to a nightclub. Then we’d go to after hours. It didn’t stop. It was definitely an occupational hazard to be Dennis’s girlfriend. He was wild.”\r\n\r\n“But to be honest, I didn’t realise what the team’s schedule was,” she continued. “I didn’t know he took a detour.”\r\n\r\nTo ensure that Rodman got back in shape after ‘blowing off steam’, Jackson organised a conditioning drill that forced everyone to match the pace of the players in front of the line.\r\n\r\nWhile most walked or jogged lightly, when Rodman reached the front of the line Jordan said he held the lead against the rest of his teammates for four laps.\r\n\r\n“He needed to get away. But in all honesty, Dennis was always there,” Jordan said. “He was always on point.”\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./226.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Basketball4.component.js",["576","577"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Basketball4.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                     <h5> GETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n5\r\nThe boycotts began when the Milwaukee Bucks did not take the floor for Game 5 of their first-round series against the Orlando Magic\r\nBoth the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers voted to boycott the remainder of the season.

not, you’re probably watching the MJ documentary ‘The Last Dance’ during lockdown.\r\n\r\nChicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n2\r\nChicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan\r\nHe’s the greatest player of all-time, an icon of sport and a trailblazer for what it means to be a modern day superstar.\r\n\r\nDuring his career, Jordan won the NBA championship six times and was the league’s Most Valuable Player in five seasons.\r\n\r\nHis incredible career, and the highs and lows that went with it, have been put together in a brilliant ten-part Netflix doc which is keeping sport fans hooked during the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nMichael Jordan flew to Las Vegas to wake Dennis Rodman up after mad 48-hour ‘holiday’\r\n\r\nIt tells the story of how MJ forged his technique and went on to become the best, taking in the difficulties he faced, his team-mates, bosses and family and the controversies his fame brought.\r\n\r\nJordan has become arguably the most well-known sportsman the world as ever known but incredibly, his sensational career got off to the worst possible start as he was cut from his high school team in his sophomore year.\r\n\r\nMotivated by his ‘failure’, the New York-native broke into the team a year later and was recruited by a cluster of the biggest basketball colleges in the country, eventually opting for the University of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./231.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n

Michael Jeffrey Jordan\r\nBorn: 17/2/1963\r\nHigh school: Laney (Wilmington, North Carolina)\r\nCollege: University of North Carolina\r\nDrafted: Chicago Bulls (1984)\r\nTransactions: Signed for Washington Wizards (25/9/2001)\r\nHeight: 6ft 6ins\r\nWeight: 216 lbs, 98kg\r\nHe helped UNC win the NCAA Championship in 1982, hitting the game-winning shot and was then drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984.\r\n\r\nMJ was drafted only third as legend Hakeem Olajuwon went first and forgotten man Sam Bowie bizarrely selected at second.\r\n\r\nNow even more driven to prove everyone he was the best, Jordan quickly settled into life in the NBA and left jaws on the floor with his outrageous play.\r\n\r\nA stunning athlete, incredible dunker, regular game-winner and mouthy trash-talker, he went on to win it all.\r\n\r\nMichael Jordan is one of sport’s greatest ever\r\n\r\n2\r\nMichael Jordan is one of sport’s greatest ever\r\nIn addition to the honours won, he was named Finals MVP six times and was an All-Star on 14 occasions, collecting a trio of All-Star MVP gongs.\r\n\r\nNot only was he a great attacking force (he was the NBA’s top scorer ten times), he was also brilliant at the other end of the court, collecting several defensive awards, including Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\r\n\r\nHe also led the league in steals in three seasons, is a two-time Slam Dunk Contest champion

           'DISRESPECTFUL' WWE legend Mark Henry reveals angry encounter with ‘disrespectful’ NBA legend Michael Jordan at 1992 Olympics\r\n   </h1><p>\r\nBy Alex McCarthy\r\n18th May 2020, 5:08 pm\r\nWhether you are currently reliving Michael Jordan’s greatness or you’re part of a younger generation witnessing it for the first time, The Last Dance documentary on Netflix has been a triumph.\r\n\r\nMany consider the 1996 iteration of the Chicago Bulls one of, if not the greatest basketball team in history and the fact Jordan won six championships in six straight full seasons – he took 18 months away for baseball – solidifies him as perhaps the greatest of all-time.\r\n\r\nChicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan is commonly regarded as the best ever\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nChicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan is commonly regarded as the best ever\r\nGetting insight into his world and mindset was a treat, but it showed the cost of being a winner, too.Jordan wasn’t always liked by his peers and he had to push certain buttons to get them up to the required level.\r\n\r\nHe had a fight with Steve Kerr in training once after his jibes went too far and WWE Hall of Famer Mark Henry – once legitimately the world’s strongest man – recalls a dicey first encounter with Air Jordan, too.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to Chip Brown of 247Sports earlier this month, Henry recalled meeting Jordan during the Olympic games. He competed in the 1992 and ’96 Olympics in powerlifting and Jordan was also at the ’92 games collecting his second gold medal.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the pair first met, Henry was not greeted warmly by Jordan when he went to visit some of the ‘Dream Team’.\r\n\r\nMark Henry did it all in WWE during his 20-year career\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./227.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       GETTY\r\n4\r\nMark Henry did it all in WWE during his 20-year career\r\n“During that time, I went to the hotel just because I wanted to see people that I knew,” Henry explained. “[Charles] Barkley being one of those people, and David Robinson and Karl Malone. You would think in a perfect world that when somebody walks up on a group of people, they would just greet everybody, “Hey, guys. How you all doing? What’s going on?” and go from there.\r\n\r\n“Well, when Michael walked up, that wasn’t the case. I guess I seemed out of place. And his response to me was, ‘Who are you?’ And I was like, ‘Who the hell are you?’ And you know, I started to get a little bit angry, because I was not expecting that.\r\n\r\n“It was like a slap in the face. It’s like someone walking up and just slapping you. I was in shock. I was like this is Michael Jordan. And I’m angry, like, ‘Why? Why? What the hell?’\r\n\r\n“He backed off. ‘Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. My bad. I didn’t want to come across,’ but he did. And, I’m sure that that’s not the only time something like that has ever happened in this world, but it had been a long time since that happened to me, and I wasn’t having no parts of it.\r\n\r\nMark Henry will be inducted into WWE's Hall of Fame during WrestleMania weekend \r\n\r\n4\r\nMark Henry is a WWE Hall of Famer, but his accomplishments in strong man and powerlifting are also legendary\r\n“My mother used to say, ‘Be careful what you say but even be more careful how you say it.’ And the way he said it to me was very disrespectful, I thought. And I checked him about it.”\r\n\r\nJordan may have been 6ft 6in, but Henry was 6ft 4in and maybe 100lbs heavier than MJ, so it’s a fight the former Chicago Bulls man did well to avoid.\r\n\r\n“The thing about it, the one thing about the story that is not told, and I guess could be told here, is he apologised,” Henry continued.\r\n\r\n“A lot of people don’t remember, but the All-Star game was coming up after that and it was in San Antonio. When that came through, he invited me to the All-Star game.\r\n\r\n“He was having his birthday party during the All-Star game. So, his people contacted me and got me a parking pass and VIP. It was all fine and good. It all ended well. It just didn’t start off. And like I said, that’s a blip on the radar.\r\n\r\nMichael Jordan would apologise to Mark Henry in the end\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nMichael Jordan would apologise to Mark Henry in the end\r\n“Michael Jordan probably don’t even remember this. And I’m sure like Barkley remembers it. We laughed about it afterwards. It wasn’t no big deal. That’s just the story of how I met Michael Jordan,” Henry explained.  \r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./228.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Basketball9.component.js",["582","583"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Basketball9.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

He wants no part of this. Mike turns to Ditka. ‘Man, you think somebody scared of you, all that racist s*** you been talking?’\r\n\r\n“He says to Dent, ‘Y’all scared of this damn white man, Richard? He ain’t nobody. You gonna let him talk that way?’\r\n\r\n“It was a circus, for real, that night. Don King trying to change the subject. Me and John trying to hold Mike down.\r\n\r\n“Mike telling everyone he’s going to bust Jordan’s ass. Jordan’s dressed sharp as always and he can’t get out of there fast enough.”\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./235.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Basketball7.component.js",["584","585"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Basketball7.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"1\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons objects_umbrella-13\"></i>\r\n                        First\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"2\" ? \"active\" : \"\"}\r\n                        href=\"#pablo\"\r\n                        onClick={(e) => {\r\n                          e.preventDefault();\r\n                          setIconPills(\"2\");\r\n                        }}\r\n                      >\r\n                        <i className=\"now-ui-icons shopping_cart-simple\"></i>\r\n                        Prev\r\n                      </NavLink>\r\n                    </NavItem>\r\n                   \r\n                  </Nav>\r\n                </CardHeader>\r\n                <CardBody>\r\n                  <TabContent\r\n                    className=\"text-center\"\r\n                    activeTab={\"iconPills\" + iconPills}\r\n                  >\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills1\">\r\n                                    <h1>         DUST UP Michael Jordan recalls time he was kicked out of Chicago Bulls practice session for punching teammate Steve Kerr\r\n</h1><p>\r\nBy talkSPORT\r\n11th May 2020, 12:00 pm Updated: 11th May 2020, 12:36 pm\r\nIf you haven’t been watching the Michael Jordan documentary on Netflix, then you should. It’s brilliant.\r\n\r\nOne of the enduring themes of ‘The Last Dance’ is Jordan’s relentless will to win, and the demands he placed upon his teammates to drive the Chicago Bulls to unprecedented levels of success.\r\n\r\nJordan is one of the most iconic figures in sports history\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nJordan is one of the most iconic figures in sports history\r\nThe outstanding basketball player of his generation – of any generation – never dropped his standards and, under coach Phil Jackson’s astute management, helped lead his team to six NBA Championships in the 1990s.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth episode of the ten-part mini-series, which is available to watch from today (Netflix are streaming two episodes a week), we get an example of Jordan’s passion and drive spilling over as his infamous fight with Steve Kerr is recalled.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, Jordan discusses the incident during pre-season in 1995 which saw him leave his Bulls teammate with a black eye. Jordan had been left enraged by the Bulls’ failure to win the NBA finals the previous season and returned even more determined to put things right and restore his team to the top of the game.\r\n\r\n“So one day at practice, Phil [Jackson] puts Steve Kerr guarding me,” Jordan recalls.\r\n\r\n“Phil sensed my aggression, but he was trying to tone me down, and he starts calling these ticky-tack fouls.\r\n\r\nKerr and Jordan played alongside each other for five years and enjoyed huge success\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nKerr and Jordan played alongside each other for five years and enjoyed huge success\r\n“Now I’m getting mad, because for you to be protecting this guy, that’s not going to help us when we play New York. That’s not going to help us when we play these teams that are very physical.\r\n\r\n“The next time he did it, I just haul off on Kerr. When I foul Steve Kerr, I said, ‘Now, that’s a f*****g foul.’\r\n\r\n“He hauls off and hits me in the chest, and I just haul off and hit him right in the f*****g eye. And Phil just throws me out of practice.”\r\n\r\nKerr also recalls the episode, saying he was not intimidated by the team’s star player.\r\n\r\n“I have a lot of patience as a human being, but I tend to snap at some point because I’m extremely competitive, too,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’m just not really good enough to back it up, usually. But I’m going to fight.”\r\n\r\nWhile Jordan was thrown out of practice, the pair kissed and made up and their relationship blossomed following the bust-up.\r\n\r\n“He called me later that day and apologised,” said Kerr, who is now the head coach of the Golden State Warriors.\r\n\r\n“We talked it out, and it was probably, in a weird way, the best thing that I ever did, was stand up for myself with him because he tested everybody he played with, and I stood up to him.\r\n\r\n“From that point on, our relationship dramatically improved and our trust in each other, everything, it was like ‘All right, we got that out of the way, we’re going to war together’.\r\n\r\nKerr has won three titles with the Warriors, to add to the five titles he won in his playing career with the Bulls and San Antonio Spurs\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTY\r\n4\r\nJordan and Kerr did not let their fall-out affect the Bulls, and won three NBA titles together\r\nThe crazy life of Dennis Rodman from wrestling with Hulk Hogan, Madonna, Michael Jordan interrupting his party with Carmen Electra and being friends with Kim Jong-un\r\n“I think this documentary is giving you a pretty good glimpse inside his life and how different his life was as a player and that probably affected his life ever since,” Kerr said.\r\n\r\n“He’s very, very private … we might run into each other once a year or so at maybe a golf tournament or All-Star Weekend or maybe in Charlotte when we play and he’s always great and it’s fun to see each other and we relive a few old times and then just move on.\r\n\r\n“But he’s always been very private and it’s easy to see why if you’re watching this documentary. His life was just total chaos. So I think he relishes his privacy now.” \r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./229.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <p>\r\n                       GETTY\r\n4\r\nKerr has won three titles with the Warriors, to add to the five titles he won in his playing career with the Bulls and San Antonio Spurs\r\nTOP SPORTS STORIES\r\n\r\nLESSON When Kubrat Pulev taunted Wladimir Klitschko and then got KOd – AJ's next opponent\r\n\r\nBIG NIGHT Joshua v Pulev undercard: Okolie and Fury in action - start time and how to watch\r\n\r\nCLAIM Hatton says he was cheated in Mayweather loss and ‘smelt a rat’ in referee Joe Cortez\r\n\r\nPASTURES NEW Rachael Ostovich cut from UFC as Yoel Romero considers Bare Knuckle FC offer\r\n\r\nMIND GAMES David Haye explains why Anthony Joshua may have a ‘slight edge’ over Tyson Fury\r\n\r\nGLEI CLUB Khabib snubs Conor McGregor as he names the toughest fight of his MMA career\r\n\r\nWORDS OF WISDOM Klitschko offers advice to Anthony Joshua after vicious KO of Pulev in 2014\r\n\r\nBAD Floyd Mayweather warned by boxing journalist that Logan Paul fight could tarnish legacy\r\n \r\n\r\nJordan explained: “I’m in the shower, and I’m saying, ‘Look, I just beat up the littlest guy on the f*****g court’. And I felt about this small.\r\n\r\n“So when I get in the car, and I call back to the United Center, I said, ‘Please give me Steve Kerr’s number.’ I call Steve and I apologise, and I said ‘Look man, it had nothing to do with you. I feel bad.’\r\n\r\n“He earned my respect because he wasn’t willing to back down to be a pawn in this whole process.”\r\n\r\nThe Bulls went on to win the NBA finals that season, with Kerr and Jordan both influential to their success.\r\n\r\nThe pair both left the Bulls in 1998, the end of the team’s dynasty.\r\n\r\nWhile they have remained on friendly terms, Kerr sees little of his famously private former teammate, who owns the Charlotte Hornets.\r\n\r\nJordan and Kerr did not let their fall-out affect the Bulls, and won three NBA titles together\r\n\r\n                      </p><div className=\"j1\" >\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./230.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Wrestling1.component.js",["586","587"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Wrestling1.component.css\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\nimport {\r\n  Card,\r\n  CardHeader,\r\n  CardBody,\r\n  NavItem,\r\n  NavLink,\r\n  Nav,\r\n  TabContent,\r\n  TabPane,\r\n  Container,\r\n  Row,\r\n  Col,\r\n} from \"reactstrap\";\r\nimport {  Image } from 'react-bootstrap';\r\n\r\n\r\n// core components\r\n\r\nfunction Tabs() {\r\n  const [iconPills, setIconPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  const [pills, setPills] = React.useState(\"1\");\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <div className=\"section section-tabs\">\r\n        <Container>\r\n          <Row>\r\n            <Col className=\"ml-auto mr-auto\" md=\"10\" xl=\"6\">\r\n              <Card style={{ width: '35rem' }}>\r\n                <CardHeader>\r\n                  <Nav className=\"justify-content-center\" role=\"tablist\" tabs>\r\n                    <NavItem>\r\n                      <NavLink\r\n                        className={iconPills === \"1\" ?

And while exactly how much Mayweather was paid is debated – with some insisting it was around the $20million region – there’s no doubt he made a pretty penny.\r\n\r\nSo of course, WWE managed to find the funny side of his latest announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again, Mayweather can see the money in facing Paul like he did when he came up against McGregor.\r\n\r\nPaul’s 22 million strong YouTube following is the same reason Eddie Hearn promoted his sole professional fight with another YouTuber, KSI.\r\n\r\nBut UFC president Dana White thinks the whole event is laughable.\r\n\r\n“When people ask me what’s the state of boxing right now, that’s where it’s at,” White said.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t that kid get beat up by the f*****g video game kid from England and now he’s going to fight Floyd Mayweather?”\r\n\r\nFor his part, Paul genuinely believes he would beat up Mayweather in virtually any setting – with a boxing ring perhaps the only exception.\r\n\r\nFloyd Mayweather made a pretty penny working with WWE\r\n\r\n4\r\nFloyd Mayweather made a pretty penny working with WWE\r\nThe 25-year-old told TMZ in November: “Let me tell you this, if I caught Floyd in a real fight, street fight, whoop his a**e! No question.\r\n\r\n“MMA? Octagon? Whoop his a**e!” The only place I think Floyd is safe obviously is the boxing ring, but to be honest, I don’t give a f**k!

Elias to end their feud.\r\n\r\nAt 43 years old, Hardy continues to put his body on the line… just watch his performance in the Intercontinental Championship ladder match from Clash of Champions in September.\r\n\r\nWhile the Wrestling Observer’s Dave Meltzer claims there was an ‘expectation’ backstage that the veteran wrestler would have picked up a concession from his spot, Fightful report he did not suffer any serious damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardy and Elias have been embroiled in a bitter feud since the former was accused of hitting the latter with a car in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe incident wrote Elias off WWE television so that he could recover from a legitimate injury.\r\n\r\nThe Drifter returned to WWE in October when he smashed Hardy with a guitar on Raw.\r\n\r\nElias defeated Hardy by disqualification at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view in October, before the pair had their final match on this week’s Raw taping.\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n

the ring.</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n                    \r\nThe 61-year-old, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016, has signed a multi-year deal with AEW.\r\n\r\nSting, a former WCW world champion, debuted in WWE when he attacked Triple H at Survivor Series in 2014.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had just two pay-per-view matches as he lost to Triple H and Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 31 and Night of Champions, respectively.\r\n\r\nSporadic appearances in WWE followed, but he never wrestled again due to long-term neck issues.\r\n\r\nHis AEW debut was not the only shock of the night as IMPACT Wrestling executive Don Callis helped Kenny Omega defeat Jon Moxley to win the world title.\r\n\r\nCallis played a big role in Omega’s world championship win\r\n\r\nAEW\r\n2\r\nCallis played a big

that microphone to bust Moxley open as he went on to end the latter’s 277-day championship reign.\r\n\r\nCallis then announced Omega would appear on IMPACT Wrestling next week.\r\n\r\nIt sees AEW and IMPACT Wrestling – the two biggest threats to WWE’s dominance in the wrestling word – join forces.  \r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\"

morning after the Frenchman’s agent publicly announced his time at Old Trafford is ‘over’.\r\n\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES\r\n2\r\nPogba has cut a forlorn figure at Old Trafford in recent months\r\nWith all eyes on United’s must-draw Champions League match against RB Leipzig – which is LIVE on talkSPORT on Tuesday night – Raiola seized the opportunity to put his client up for sale yet again, despite little transfer speculation and a return to form for Pobga over the weekend.\r\n\r\nEven still, Raiola’s comments do not come as too much of a surprise, given his outspoken nature.\r\n\r\nThe agent has made numerous public statements about Pogba down the years, and more recently he was very vocal about Man United’s failed pursuit of Erling Haaland, another one of his clients.\r\n\r\nAlongside hoping to engineer a transfer for Pogba, Raiola is also trying to ‘delete the FIFA video game from existing’ due to a copyright dispute between EA Sports and his client Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\r\n\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\n\r\nGETTY IMAGES - GETTY\r\n2\r\nRaiola represents a number of high-profile players across Europe\r\nAnd O’Hara is quite frankly sick of it.\r\n\r\n“He’s all about himself, making a name for himself and bigging himself up,” O’Hara told Tuesday’s talkSPORT Breakfast.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got this player, I can end FIFA, Pogba’s finished – just shut up, mate!\r\n\r\n“Seriously, if he was my agent, I would phone him up and say, ‘Keep you mouth shut, I’m playing for Manchester United, I’m not playing well, I’ve just scored on the weekend and now I’m thrown all over the papers again’.”\r\n\r\nThere are some suggestions that Pogba would’ve known about his agent’s comments, but O’Hara was keen to defend the Frenchman from any blame, insisting responsibility for the saga lies with Raiola.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n

he’s like that.\r\n\r\n“Whether or not he’s happy at Man United, I still think he’s a professional, he still wants to do well for the club, and when he plays, he tries.\r\n\r\n“Your agent is someone who represents you off the field, who keeps their mouth shut and does business behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have an agent who is constantly running their mouth off to the press, that is not what you’re hired to do.\r\n\r\n“I wish he would just shut up and let Pogba play his football.”\r\n\r\ntalkSPORT brings you full LIVE commentary of RB Leipzig vs Manchester United in the Champions

instilled in opponents.\r\n\r\nHe rightly has a place in boxing’s Hall of Fame and the heavyweight legend is also a fully paid up member of the WWE version.\r\n\r\n‘Iron Mike’ is one of the squared circle’s most legendary figures, which is why his comeback to the ring – at 54 years old – is such big news.\r\n\r\nWill the fear factor still be there?

And the man who helped them turn the tide was Michael Gerard Tyson.\r\n\r\nThe former undisputed heavyweight champion agreed to work with WWE and performed as a special guest referee at WrestleMania 14 in 1998 in the classic between Shawn Michaels and Stone Cold Steve Austin that saw the latter win his first world title.\r\n\r\nPlay Video\r\n'Iron' Mike Tyson shares hilarious video of family eating Roy Jones Jr head for thanksgiving dinner\r\nFollowing on from that momentum swinger, Tyson appeared occasionally in WWE. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012, but in 2010, he actually competed in a match alongside Jericho on RAW.\r\n\r\nThey faced off against the Unified Tag Team champions, D-Generation-X,  the group Tyson had turned his back on when Austin won the title were meeting again, but there was a twist in store\r\n\r\nJericho was the total heel at this point and was obviously going to push Tyson too far on the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guys had devised a spot where Tyson would ‘knock Jericho out’ on RAW, but Jericho was terrified that was actually going to happen. After all, who knew if Tyson had a ‘working’ punch or if he was just legit.\r\n\r\n“The moment before he swung at me, I told him, ‘Just wait until I put my hands up in the air, and swing,’” Jericho told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\r\n\r\n“Time stood still. I am the craziest man on the planet right now, because I’m waiting for Iron Mike Tyson to take a swing at me.\r\n\r\nTyson looks as lean as he did in his prime as he prepares to fight Roy Jones Jr in his first fight since 2005\r\n\r\n\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./193.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    <TabPane tabId=\"iconPills2\">\r\n                      <h4>Tyson looks as lean as he did in his prime as he prepares to fight Roy Jones Jr in his first fight since 2005\r\n“I thought ‘I’m going to let him do it.

What if he misses?’”\r\n\r\nLuckily for Jericho, Tyson executed the punch perfectly, but the precision he did it with terrified Jericho even more.</h4><p>\r\n                       4\r\n\r\n\r\n“He barely grazed me, but I felt a wind go by my face,” Jericho said. “That’s how fast he swung. It was like a ‘Swoosh!’ Who swings that hard and leaves a vapour trail?!\r\n\r\n“He was so fast and so powerful. I couldn’t imagine how powerful he was 20 years earlier,” Jericho recalls.\r\n\r\nTyson was the most feared man on the planet for a generation\r\n\r\nTHE RING MAGAZINE VIA GETTY IMAGES\r\n4\r\nTyson was the most feared man on the planet for a generation\r\nOnce you agree to get punched by Tyson – real or fake – suddenly you have nothing left to fear, at least in the mind of Jericho.\r\n\r\n“Nothing could ever scare me ever again, after standing face-to-face with Mike Tyson, knowing he’s going to swing at me, and giving him 100 per cent trust he’s not going to knock me out and kill me.”\r\n\r\nTyson, now 53, has shown recently that he is still a very, very scary man all things considered.\r\n\r\nJericho actually had Tyson on his podcast in 2017, but Iron Mike had very little to say. He obviously wasn’t in the mood to talk and Jericho was forced to acknowledge this fact with his fans.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t want to talk. He was giving me one-word answers. Guess what? I gotta get a show. So you know what I decided? Alright, Mike. You don’t want to talk to me? You can sit there and listen while I talk to you. And that’s what happened.\r\n\r\nTyson took part in WrestleMania 14 and joined forces with DX\r\n\r\n4\r\nTyson took part in WrestleMania 14 and joined forces with DX\r\n“Forty minutes of me talking, seven minutes of him giving one-word answers, and we got a show out of it. Was it great? I’m not sure it was great. But was it a great test for me as an interviewer? By far.”\r\n\r\nTyson is now doing plenty of talking – with those fast hands again as he prepares to return for an exhibition bout.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty who do not want to see him back in the ring, but then again, there are plenty who want to see if he still has that knockout power.\r\n\r\nDownload the talkSPORT app and listen to a huge heavyweight night of action this Saturday, with live and exclusive radio commentary of Daniel Dubois vs Joe Joyce followed by live coverage of Mike Tyson’s return to the ring against Roy Jones Jr at 3am on Sunday morning\r\n                      </p>\r\n                                            <div className=\"j1\" >\r\n\r\n                      <Col xs={6} md={4}>\r\n      <Image src=\"./194.PNG\" thumbnail />\r\n    </Col></div>\r\n                    </TabPane>\r\n                    \r\n                   \r\n                  </TabContent>\r\n                </CardBody>\r\n              </Card>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            \r\n          </Row>\r\n        </Container>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Tabs;\r\n\r\n","C:\\Users\\ahmed\\Desktop\\projet football\\frontend\\src\\components\\Footer.component.js",["604","605","606","607","608","609","610","611","612","613","614"],"import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./Footer.component.css\";\r\nimport { Container,Row, Col } from \"reactstrap\";\r\n\r\n// reactstrap components\r\n\r\nfunction DarkFooter(){\r\n  return (\r\n    <footer className=\"footer\" data-background-color=\"black\">\r\n      <Container>\r\n      <Row>\r\n      <Col>\r\n        \r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n\r\nServices\r\nAdvertise with us\r\n\r\n\r\n          </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://presentation.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Advertising specs\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n               Brand guidelines\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li></ul>\r\n            </Col>\r\n            <Col>\r\n            <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Competition rules\r\n\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Contact us\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n               Work for us\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n            </ul></Col>\r\n            <Col>\r\n            <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                License content\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n             <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Privacy policy\r\n\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n             <li>\r\n              <a\r\n                href=\"http://blog.creative-tim.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n                target=\"_blank\"\r\n              >\r\n                Terms of use\r\n\r\n              </a>\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </Col>\r\n        <div className=\"copyright\" id=\"copyright\">\r\n          © {new Date().getFullYear()}, Designed by{\" \"}\r\n          <a\r\n            href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com?ref=nukr-dark-footer\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"\r\n          >\r\n            Invision\r\n          </a>\r\n          .
